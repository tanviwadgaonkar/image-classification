# Image Classification Project

This project is an image classification system using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Model evaluation

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/raw/` directory.
3. Run `src/train.py` to train the model.
4. Run `src/evaluate.py` to evaluate the model.

## Notebooks
- `notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb` - Explore and visualize the dataset.
- `notebooks/model_training.ipynb` - Train the model and tune hyperparameters.
- `notebooks/results_analysis.ipynb` - Analyze the results and metrics.
