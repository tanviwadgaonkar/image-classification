# Image Classification using CNN

A convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image classification with around 95% accuracy.

## Features
- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation
- Custom CNN architecture (TensorFlow / Keras)
- Training, validation, and testing pipeline
- Visualization of accuracy and loss

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanviwadgaonkar/image-classification.git
cd image-classification

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Example commands
python train.py
python evaluate.py
## My Contribution
- Implemented the CNN architecture from scratch  
- Performed dataset preprocessing and augmentation  
- Tuned hyperparameters to improve model accuracy  
- Generated training graphs and evaluation metrics
